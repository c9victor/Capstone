# Capstone
Fall 2021 Capstone Project  

Our Capstone project focuses on solving Sudoku puzzles using the Dancing Link algorithm and visualizing this solving process. Before moving on, I will define some vocabulary that is critical to understanding this project.

- Exact Cover Problem:
- Algorithm X: an algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem.
- Dancing Link algorithm: allows one to efficiently revert the deletion of a node from a circular doubly-linked list. This makes it a very effective way of implementing backtracking algorithms. It is used to implement Donald Knuth's Algorithm X.
